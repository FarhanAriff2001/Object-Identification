# Object-Identification
## Overview
Built an object classification model using TensorFlow, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract and learn features from image data. Implemented data preprocessing and model training pipelines, and fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy and training efficiency. Achieved faster convergence and improved performance through iterative experimentation and model optimization.

## Features
- Image classification using CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers
- Multiclass classification across 10 object categories (CIFAR-10 dataset)
- Data preprocessing pipeline including normalization and train/test splitting
- Iterative hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy and convergence
- Model implementation using both Sequential and Functional TensorFlow APIs
- Performance benchmarking comparing basic neural networks vs. CNN-based architectures

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Frameworks / Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Google Colab, CIFAR-10 Dataset
